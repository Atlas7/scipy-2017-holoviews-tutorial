    "\n",
    "HoloViews is an [open-source](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews) Python library designed to make data analysis and visualization seamless and simple. With HoloViews, you can usually express what you want to do in very few lines of code, letting you focus on what you are trying to explore and convey, not on the process of plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HoloViews helps you understand your data better, by letting you work seamlessly with both the data** ***and*** **its graphical representation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with HoloViews, the focus is on bundling your data together with the appropriate metadata to support both analysis and visualization, making your raw data and its visualization equally accessible at all times.  This tutorial will introduce HoloViews and guide you through the process of building rich, deployable visualizations with HoloViews and [Bokeh](bokeh.pydata.org) with exercises you are encouraged to try yourself.\n",
