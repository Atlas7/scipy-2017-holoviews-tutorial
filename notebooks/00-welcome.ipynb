    "HoloViews is an [open-source](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews) Python library designed to make data analysis and visualization seamless and simple. With HoloViews, you can usually express what you want to do in very few lines of code, letting you focus on what you are trying to explore and convey, not on the process of plotting. This tutorial will introduce HoloViews and guide you through the process of building rich, deployable visualizations with HoloViews and [Bokeh](bokeh.pydata.org) with exercises you are encouraged to try yourself.
